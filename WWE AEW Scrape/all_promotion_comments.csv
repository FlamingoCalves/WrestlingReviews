Every time I try and watch a Raw episode today I just find the whole product insulatingly bad. Historically this would have easily been a 10 because for all the bad there was just so many iconic moments like Hogan slamming Andre, Austin v McMahon pushing the envelope, the countless classics from wrestlers like Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels etc. Wrestlemania was THE show every star wanted to be a part of.

WWE has a lot of rich history and produced so many memories throughout so many decades, from the Buddy Rogers era to the Ruthless Aggression era. But since the start of the PG era, the WWE has been a downward spiral of nonsense that no one can figure out. The saving grace to WWE was NXT, spearheaded by Triple H, and this brand really came into it's own in 2013 and up until 2021, NXT was on fire, and had the world talking.. and now the word is that Vince McMahon has decided to step in and completely change everything that Triple H has built. That is a FAIL. NXT will now look similar to the TRASH known as RAW & SmackDown, if that is the case. This could also mean that NXT UK may just now be in fact the WWE's best brand, but it is only a 1 hour weekly show on the WWE Network. LOL. WWE's new hiring process is also an eye opener, which means that the future of the company might just be TRASH as well, because WWE's built from scratch wrestlers are usually TRASH for the most part. Rarely do you get a Brock Lesnar, John Cena, The Rock, Kurt Angle, Trish Stratus, Charlotte Flair, Bianca Belair, etc. That is VERY rare.

wwe,2021-01-23,8.0,"""The WWF has socialized me (next to WCW) in terms of wrestling and, of course, swinging strongly with my perception in 2021. Many of my most intense wrestling experiences associate with the Wwe. Markout moments, live events, huge anticipation On PPVs, dermade nights, because the PPV had a horny card, Watch parties. All that I connect with the WWE and that's in part of exactly 2021 so. And then, in addition to all the problem that the market leader brings with it , Positioning at the US Entertainment Market still brings too much problems for me and that is generally a development that I see critically and often reduces my entertainment factor. The way away from Wrestling to the Sports Entertainment is from AG View comprehensible, but as a consumer, I'm not in the target group in many parts. But the WWE is so wide that you can get something for yourself 2021 and in the Main Roster is not all bad either. In general, in Stamford sit too many TV writer and too little wrestling heads. The focus on Sports Entertainment is always active in the center, which does not believe in my opinion. But to my scare are exactly the angles and people who produce YT-Clicks and Twitter hearts. Why should the WWE change it? People like Cornette then bring the 80s to the table and regret the dead of Kayfabe. I also conquer me, but it remains hypothetical if the (impossible) return could bring similar clicks. So I have to live with that people I think for very talented are external ones and are the focus of people who even move from the point of view of the WWE. As for the WWE as an employer in recent years, one can only see a positive positive and American capitalism and associated labor market is generally a problem. It can only be better. The production level converts between ingenious and artificial. But especially in artificiality, US sports have been a slightly different view of Support and of course, the WWE becomes more and more to the TV show and away from the spot sport, which should cause real emotions.

And if you still are not convinced that WWE is not the company that should represent pro wrestling in the world here are some other reasons: most of the wrestlers who either have been fired or demanded their release have explained stories that will make you not want to work for them, they do not let wrestlers evolve on their characters, cut their own promos and they have JBL under contract, someone who harassed a working partner of his.

wwe,2020-07-13,9.0," ""How on earth do I fairly review the WWE? Do I focus heavily on the questionable, childish booking that has become more prominent over the last ten years or so, or do I focus more on the company's prior 50 years of history? Do I focus more on the memories this company gave me? And the nightmares I got from watching a toothless Mankind smile his bloody gums at me after falling through a 20-foot structure, or from watching a 6'11 deadman set his co-workers ablaze? Perhaps I should think about the Golden Era, where Hulkamania was running wild and thousands of fans were packing into the Silverdome and the millions were watching around the world as the All American Hogan slammed a 500-pound giant. It's an impossible task. What stays consistent, however, is that in WWE, when it rains it pours, and when it shines, it doesn't get brighter. When WWE does good, whether that's a Hogan slamming an Andre or a Stone Cold giving the finger to the boss or more recently a Daniel Bryan fighting his way into the main event of Wrestlemania, it does great. Those moments feel so fulfilling to watch happen and no other wrestling company can fight that feeling. However, WWE is no stranger to dropping the ball and missing golden opportunities whether it's to create a five-star classic or to build a new star, WWE's booking has been questionable to the hardcore fans for years now, often to the point of sheer boredom from audiences. But, as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it makes those special moments whether it's a Daniel Bryan/Authority or Kofi Kingston/Daniel Bryan rivalry feel so much more special. But fans like myself feel so much more frustrated to see WWE drop the ball on a 'Rusev Day' or an NXT call up which, at this point, has become almost humorous as WWE has such a consistent history of burying their popular stars from their third brand. Another problem 2020 WWE faces is its sheer lack of ability to create new stars, almost all of the current stars of WWE found their success in other promotions like TNA or NJPW or ROH, most NXT stars come from Evolve instead of being Performance Centre homegrowns. And WWE also has a frustrating habit of putting its older, retired icons over their younger upcoming stars. The fact that the cover star of the upcoming WWE 2K Battlegrounds is Stone Cold Steve Austin, a man who hasn't wrestled since 2003, really speaks on WWE's star building credentials. But if we look away from today's WWE, you see all the timeless moments it has created over the last sixty years, some I've already named.

The future seems really bright with current stars like AJ Styles, Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Aleister Black, Daniel Bryan, Sasha Banks, Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt among others, and the matches they can put on from time to time are still great. Additionally, they have also been improving the quality of their PPVs.

wwe,2019-11-23,6.0,"""The WWE is very difficult, especially since you have such a long history and have such a wide range of bandwidth. There was always strong and weak phases in WWE history. In the 80s, they are the top promotion in the USA where I find the roster of the then NWA shows or the then resulting WCW far more interesting find. The first half of the 90s was very weak. However, the Attitude Era was one of the strongest phases of the promotion and offered very Utnerhondame moments, but less crass In Ring Action. However, this focus was less an innovation of the WWE as an answer to other leagues. The 2000s were just half pretty strong and probably the best phase of WWE story. That was mainly because you want to get the Roster from WWE , WCW and ECW had. In the end, however, the use of these, as always in WWE history, was disappointing. However, since 2007, the product has been steadily steadily and there is no End in sight. There is so much that disturbs me at the WWE, that would blow up the frame. Of course, there have been NXT since then, but the main shows pull the whole thing back so that NXT makes the rating hardly better. In addition, a call-up into the Main Roster is unfortunately sometimes a bit of which you are afraid, rather than you are looking forward to it. In general, you have to say that the WWE has never shown the best wrestling. Of course, they have produced outstanding wrestlers, but most of the really big wrestlers were bought and were not allowed to show their whole potential for a long time. And for years they have not exercised any more than solid wrestler. But that was never the strength of the WWE, which was much more creating the big moments, the big clashes between the over-stars.

wwe,2018-02-08,1.0," ""They're the biggest wrestling promotion in the world, and the place where countless memorable matches and moments have happened in its extensive history. It's also a shame that it has also had countless failures and let downs over its history, as well. Awful is the status quo in the WWE, with many moments of mediocrity, and brief glimpses of excellence that usually happen in spite of themselves. One major example of this was Daniel Bryan. He had become their biggest star more or less on his own; not out of some forced-down-your-throat, war-of-attrition case like Cena or Roman. And it's because he had connected to the audience in such a magnificent way, that they were forced to let him have his time to shine (regrettably, Bryan's time as a competitor is probably over). WWE's booking is consistently terrible, to the point where any time something exciting seems to happen, you have to ask not if, but when, and how they'll **** it up. Their writing is equally unbearable; no matter how charismatic their performers may be, they're forced to follow a hollow script of what their writing team thinks makes wrestlers who they are, and not allowing the wrestlers the freedom to express themselves and have them connect to the audience emotionally and authentically. No wrestler there feels special in the way a Hogan, Stone Cold or Rock did, and it's astounding to me how they managed that with a roster that has the likes of Nakamura, Owens, Zayn, Asuka, Styles and Lesnar. It's because even with that caliber of talent, their weekly shows are so routine and monotonous. They've failed on so many opportunities to make new stars, they've failed to bolster the ratings which steadily go down year after year, but apparently they still make a ton of money, so I guess business is good and everything is fine!

Speculative economic decisions are about quality, which proves approximately the WWE title win of a Jinder Mahal, with which one wants to conquer the Indian market. Many talents have the review. Outputs like that of a Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes or Austin Aries will not remain individual symptoms in the long term. Added to That Part Timer, which means fast money for the league, always get the priority in front of the Main-Roster for the Main Event. Brock Lesnar as Universal Champion thus disappears well and like months from the shows. Hopping aid as the Womens Revolution turns out to be disappointment because behind the curtains do not believe enough of the old-established responsible persons - and short-handed a man gain the first women's money in the bank Ladder Match.

For every good thing they do, they do at least two as bad. Extremely hit and miss variety show, with most shows leaning towards the latter. Their pay per views, for the most part, have been good, occasionally very good, but the womens division, overused ""comedy"" segments, repetition, and booking hasn't been up to scratch, and match quality nowhere near the heights suggested, outside of some excellent tag matches every so often, usually involving The Young Bucks. For me, AEW has lost it's charm, much of which is due to Tony Khan, including going against his word and becoming a weak on screen character and showing nothing of the sort ""sports presentation"", Kenny/Bucks/Cody social media antics and their own loss of charm, repetitive, weak booking, poor use of new talent, and being everything they said they wouldn't be. The world does not need a WWE lite, it needs an alternative. The ratings have gone down for these reasons; get back on track before it's too late. Of course, the hardcore fans will give you 5* matches or 10/10 for every show, but those that actually care about long term success and can see through the trees, know what changes need to be made. The promotion seems split down the middle at the moment, WWE Lite, and PWG Lite, with a little NJPW sprinkled in, which leads to nowhere. Go one way or the other, or better yet, become what you set out to be. The alternative that brings fans and promotions together to create something great. At the moment, it appears a promotion and fanbase that cannot accept any criticism, and thinks ""Everything Is Awesome! "" while things go from bad to worse. Get back to what it was in 2019 and revitalise the booking, utilise the talent at hand that know what works in 2022, and find the rewards. As it stands, this is a promotion going downhill and becoming a WWE alternative rather than a true alternative to WWE, yet has tremendous potential if it can stop being the self congratulatory promotion that wants to pat itself on the back, rather than achieve something special.

Too many matches rely on the ""fit-in-all-your-spots"" style found in the indies and very little actual ring psychology. There are way too many near-fall kickouts, which, again, is a sign of a lack of understanding of ring psychology -- there are moves that wrestlers shouldn't be able to kick out of without someone else breaking up the count, and no one should *ever* be able to kick out after, say, taking a hit to the head from a foreign object unless someone else is there to make the save.

There's a great mix of absolute stars, great wrestlers on the cusp of becoming stars with the right booking, fantastic young up-and-comers, solid workhorses, past-their-prime veterans who are still good hands, and various other decent mid-carders and lower-carders who help fill up ranks. When rumours star brewing around AEW, they're usually correct AND they're paid off well, which is very rare these days. I personally think that basically all AEW matches that get the ""best match ever! "" reactions are vastly overrated, since I've only given a handful of AEW matches ****1/4 at the absolute highest, but the company still has probably at least one great match every other month, plus a bunch of matches each month ranging from pretty good to very good, ensuring that weekly Dynamite and Rampage episodes are interesting.

aew,2021-10-24,7.0," ""AEW has, for the most part, hit it out of the park so far. Most episodes of TV are usually at least passable, which can't always be said about WWE (their biggest competition). Match quality is usually good, however my biggest issue with AEW is it's storytelling, or, in the case of the women's division, non-existent storytelling. It's usually either barely there or set up on one of the YouTube shows. The exception is usually for PPV's but those are very infrequent. The world champion is regularly treading water with no storyline going on. The tag belts are usually the same way but to a lesser extent. The TNT title usually has a story going on, and if it doesn't it's usually made up for in open challenges. Women's title is the biggest victim, with little storytelling or promos from anyone besides Britt Baker. The challenger sometimes never gets to talk in the build to the title match. It's honestly tragic. Another issue I have with AEW is an issue with predictability. Almost every match on Dynamite every single week has an obvious result days before the match even takes place. As I said earlier, the matches usually deliver, but frequently lack heat because the winner is already known, so any nearfalls the loser of the match gets, the audience can't buy into it. Regardless of those significant issues, I have some other things I like AEW does. One of them is that they listen to their fanbase. If an angle doesn't get over or work out it is usually scrapped in a way that makes sense. I also like how they consistently try to make wrestling a focal point of their programming as opposed to 20 minute in ring promos. I also like how they make their titles feel important by protecting them from eating unnecessary losses in matches that aren't for the title. Overall, AEW has a lot of upside, but some major flaws prevent me from rating it any higher than a 7.""",Mark,aew has for the most part hit it out of the park so far most episodes of tv are usually at least passable which cant always be said about wwe their biggest competition match quality is usually good however my biggest issue with aew is its storytelling or in the case of the womens division nonexistent storytelling its usually either barely there or set up on one of the youtube shows the exception is usually for ppvs but those are very infrequent the world champion is regularly treading water with no storyline going on the tag belts are usually the same way but to a lesser extent the tnt title usually has a story going on and if it doesnt its usually made up for in open challenges womens title is the biggest victim with little storytelling or promos from anyone besides britt baker the challenger sometimes never gets to talk in the build to the title match its honestly tragic another issue i have with aew is an issue with predictability almost every match on dynamite every single week has an obvious result days before the match even takes place as i said earlier the matches usually deliver but frequently lack heat because the winner is already known so any nearfalls the loser of the match gets the audience cant buy into it regardless of those significant issues i have some other things i like aew does one of them is that they listen to their fanbase if an angle doesnt get over or work out it is usually scrapped in a way that makes sense i also like how they consistently try to make wrestling a focal point of their programming as opposed to minute in ring promos i also like how they make their titles feel important by protecting them from eating unnecessary losses in matches that arent for the title overall aew has a lot of upside but some major flaws prevent me from rating it any higher than a,334

Most people have had AEW as an alternative to WWE since it's inception 2 years ago, and quickly moved it's way to the top that near ends their flagship program in the ratings, and somewhat in the quality as well. I do believe WWE has had better matches this year considerably while told better stories in their matches and the ones leading up to it, so what makes AEW better? The booking and how to handle a wrestler individually, how to make them fucking stars. WWE does that by abrupt cash-ins that feels rushed in, AEW is a slow burn that makes it work, Britt Baker being an example, can't wrestle for shit, but the way she's booked as a charismatic heel, is why she's at the top, it's amazing how they accomplished that, and for smart writers and helps it being a more mature programming work, they're expanding themselves in the realm of modern mainstream wrestling. So why not a perfect 10? A) The booking's not always perfect, and sometimes have piss poor booking decisions. B) The toxicity they reek of, in this site, on Twitter, on any other social media site, biased criticism even by the ""holy gospel"" of Journalists in Meltzer (How is Ilja Dragunov vs Walter a 5.25/the triple threat at Mania 37 a 4.5/Gargano vs Kushida a 4.75, when an indie spotfest that has always had the same feel to it 5+ stars), Dirt Sheet and Alvarez. Why can't they enjoy both when both of them are doing great currently and let others enjoy what they want to, that question is always beyond me. Hope that does change soon though. C) Can't seem not to make this about themselves, always have to drag WWE in any promo chance they get with the inferiority complex they have, Punk did it in his debut, Britt Baker did it recently, you get the point, I don't have much space to conclude.

Jericho, a true legend I have no problem to say that, Moxley, an ex WWE champ, and Omega, a wrestler that won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. And with these young big talents, like Guevara or Kip Sabian, who are not really known from most of wrestling fans, because they are from the indies ( and they did a great job in them, no problem with that ), they prefer push MJF. Really ? Saying that makes me laugh, but it's the reality. When I started watching AEW, I was in a point of my life as wrestling fan where I was not too much into it, so I really liked the Dynamite episodes, and you can even see a full 10 in my matchguide for an AEW match ( and moreover, it's a Young Bucks match, what I really can't do today, because I grown since Revolution 2020 as a wrestling fan ).

AEW's fanbase is awful. The worst fanbase I have ever seen, like it's said in the comment just below me, calling someone who doesn't like their products ""WWE marks"", and understanding nothing.

They already destroyed Impact so much that I don't even watch it anymore, and for those who knows me well, they know that Impact is a federation that I love from the bottom of my heart since I started to watch wrestling. Omega as Impact champ is a shame and someone who doesn't understand it is simply unable to see the symbolic of this. The Impact shows are just AEW's garbage. They put Private Party here just because they had no storylines in AEW, and because for them Impact is inferior. AEW have adds for their weekly shows in every Impact show, and what Impact has in return ? Nothing, not even having a guy of the company as World Champion. AEW's partnership with Impact destroyed the so meaningful storyline between Swann and Moose. They get exposition ? No, they get destroyed.

Long has the wrestling world cried out for an alternative to sports entertainment on this scale and I believe that AEW are mostly delivering. The in-ring style has a feel that once would be described as ""indie"", that now could really just be described as the standard pro wrestling style outside of WWE. The pace is quick and workrate high, rest holds being reserved for ad breaks during Dynamite where the coverage for international audiences remains uninterrupted and the US viewership are treated to the famous ""pitcher in pitcher"". On this very important facet they are unmatched by their American peers, head and shoulders above other wrestling network television presentations. That said, they are far within the boundaries for valid criticism on many fronts. Production is lacking with sound levels failing to be normalized and important spots missed. Forgivable in their freshman year, less so now. Nepotism within the Nightmare Family has led to bad angles, from bizarre to shambolic, and even at a title level storylines have often gone weeks without address, and too often petered out altogether. Boss Tony Khan is clearly a fan first, and while this is more beneficial than detrimental in my eyes, it does lead to his foot in his mouth too often for my liking, both when on promotional duty and in his post-show scrums. Despite all this, however, to rate it any lower than I have done would be a disservice. AEW have raised the bar for the entire North American scene at the top level. If WWE ran weekly shows the quality of AEW before the latter's inception, we would declare it a new golden era for the fed.

aew,2021-03-13,6.0," ""As we approach a year and a half of AEW TV I think it's worth giving an initial appraisal. While absolutely beloved in the west, the reality is that AEW for many of the original fans of the core group of wrestlers was false advertising. It was purported to be something akin to a western take on New Japan featuring all those great work rate guys from the indies and the elite. It was going to take back wrestling for the fan and the wrestler. To some extent it did accomplish this. It's clear that working in the environment is better for the wrestlers, but it failed on a sports presentation front. AEW is essentially a Super Indy on TV. A mixture of old school 90s wrestling with modern work rate guys and a tongue in cheek modern Indy-like feel. For simplicity sake WCW crossed with PWG. Or Perhaps even more simply a better WWE that is more meta. I did not really want to see American TV Wrestling, I wanted to see a true evolution. Maybe the true evolution is not a revert to it's more sports flavored origin, but doing WWE's style better with twists wasn't exactly what I was clamoring for. AEW as whole is incredibly hit or miss. Miro and Kip doing some weird twitch gamer hype beast gimmick is a miss, but paired the Trent and Chuckie T I enjoyed. They have had moments of true brilliance like the Hangman and Omega feud, or the first Moxley vs. Omega, but then they had stuff like the original Dark Order presentation. I know precisely what I want from a wrestling company thanks to watching AEW. It's compelling stories featuring convincing characters that pay off with great matches, and championships that mean something. And AEW can achieve this on a rare occasions, but not as consistently as I would like. One of my major complaints is the failure of AEW to deliver a truly great overall PPV. They have not hit that for me yet, which is probably not the case for most people. The closest they came for me was DoN 2019, but the only truly great match was Dustin vs. Cody. Revolution 2020 had an amazing run on TV up to the PPV, but the PPV itself was quite weak. They sometimes wait far too long to build up meaningful feuds in time for the PPVs this has been a major issue. All Out 2020 is a prime example of this. The women's division is also a mess. The roster itself has improved a lot with additions like Leyla Hirsch, Thunder Rosa, and Serena Deeb, but has some major problems. Most of them just aren't good enough especially compared to their contemporaries in NXT which arguably has the best women's roster in the world and this coming from someone who watches a ton of Joshi.

For all of the things that one can nitpick, Tony Khan and the creative minds behind the promotion have put together the most exciting wrestling program in the US since WCW's Monday Nitro in the mid 1990s. Anyone complaining about the in-ring style is missing out on what makes AEW so unique. It's a criticism that has held wrestling back for far too long and did so much damage to promotions like IMPACT and WCW over time. AEW should feel no need to compete with the WWE and no fan should expect that, especially from an in-ring perspective. The criticisms of the women's division are completely valid. However, while AEW cannot compete with the WWE, the WWE still does contract the VAST MAJORITY of well trained, high level wrestlers (and trainers) in the US which left AEW with very few options to build their roster. The usage (or lack-thereof) of the women's division is where I would like to see some improvement. My other criticism stems from the ""sports entertainment"" aspects of the show. Some segments and characters have drifted too far away from the realm of professional wrestling. While I realize not everything has to appeal to me, I have also found AEW's attempts to appeal to casual/new fans as off-putting. From Tyson to Shaq, all of these attempts at generating interest haven't hit with me. I think their best attempt at this was Snoop Dogg's feature, which is all I'd ever want from a celebrity appearance on a wrestling show. AEW Dark has been a great proving ground for both female and male talents. I look forward to seeing a third hour of programming. One element I'd love to see added would be a trios championship, as I feel AEW's roster is built for such an idea. Working relationships with IMPACT and other US independent promotions could open up the door for greener talent on both sides of the roster to get reps and improve down the line. I firmly believe the pandemic hindered much of what AEW had planned for 2020 yet their adaptations were excellent for such a new promotion. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that no promotion was better booked in 2020. I truly appreciate their ability to keep me interested week after week. While I've found myself disagreeing with different elements of the show, they've consistently found a way to hook me back in. With an absolute wealth of young, albeit inexperienced, talent I believe All Elite Wrestling is a promotion that has defied critics expectations and will continue to grow and improve over time. Their newly established relationship with New Japan Pro-Wrestling will only solidify this belief. The promotion's approach to the wrestling business as a whole should only contribute to its positive standing with fans as they exist to elevate wrestling as a whole, NOT to buy up everything around them and be the only show in town. If for no other reason, that is why I personally enjoy AEW so much.""",Mark,as of february i would give all elite wrestling a out of for all of the things that one can nitpick tony khan and the creative minds behind the promotion have put together the most exciting wrestling program in the us since wcws monday nitro in the mid anyone complaining about the inring style is missing out on what makes aew so unique its a criticism that has held wrestling back for far too long and did so much damage to promotions like impact and wcw over time aew should feel no need to compete with the wwe and no fan should expect that especially from an inring perspective the criticisms of the womens division are completely valid however while aew cannot compete with the wwe the wwe still does contract the vast majority of well trained high level wrestlers and trainers in the us which left aew with very few options to build their roster the usage or lackthereof of the womens division is where i would like to see some improvement my other criticism stems from the sports entertainment aspects of the show some segments and characters have drifted too far away from the realm of professional wrestling while i realize not everything has to appeal to me i have also found aews attempts to appeal to casualnew fans as offputting from tyson to shaq all of these attempts at generating interest havent hit with me i think their best attempt at this was snoop doggs feature which is all id ever want from a celebrity appearance on a wrestling show aew dark has been a great proving ground for both female and male talents i look forward to seeing a third hour of programming one element id love to see added would be a trios championship as i feel aews roster is built for such an idea working relationships with impact and other us independent promotions could open up the door for greener talent on both sides of the roster to get reps and improve down the line i firmly believe the pandemic hindered much of what aew had planned for yet their adaptations were excellent for such a new promotion in fact id go as far as to say that no promotion was better booked in i truly appreciate their ability to keep me interested week after week while ive found myself disagreeing with different elements of the show theyve consistently found a way to hook me back in with an absolute wealth of young albeit inexperienced talent i believe all elite wrestling is a promotion that has defied critics expectations and will continue to grow and improve over time their newly established relationship with new japan prowrestling will only solidify this belief the promotions approach to the wrestling business as a whole should only contribute to its positive standing with fans as they exist to elevate wrestling as a whole not to buy up everything around them and be the only show in town if for no other reason that is why i personally enjoy aew so much,513

AEW do however have their own issues, like every promotion, nothing is perfect. AEW claim they want to be Sports orientated and even created a ""Rankings"" system, however they do not always stick to the rankings and they often appear wrong during a wrestlers introduction. Every commentator seems to have different names for almost every move, which is irritating. Talking of moves, AEW wrestlers often use other AEW wrestlers finishers within their standard movesets, which for me kind of ruins that finisher (would be like Ishii giving Okada a Rainmaker onto a chair and not going for the cover as its a standard move, then Okada winning with a regular Rainmaker).

Dynamite for me has been the best wrestling show for a couple of months now, and the quality of matches that show produces is scary. I love seen Schiavone back on commentary, he's clearly loving this second lease on life in wrestling. Excalibur is great. Also given the talent creative freedom is a smart move.

NWA:TNA was, to be blunt, absolute garbage for the first couple years, aside from guys like Jerry Lynn and AJ Styles and Low Ki carrying the company on their backs with the X-Division. But as the years went by it slowly shifted away from being a carbon copy of WCW's twilight years to some actually very good programming by the late 00's. Then Hogan showed up. Like Bryan Alvarez famously said, TNA for some reason decided to hire all the people on the cover of The Death of WCW book. The Hogan/Bischoff experiment simply didn't work, mostly for the same reason WCW was really only popular and successful for about two or three years before it all fell apart. Then you had the Aces and Eights saga, which started off great but fizzled out with a whimper. Then the money issues really started happening and TNA seemed to be at risk of going out of business on almost a weekly basis. Billy Corgan, of all people, wound up taking the show over and honestly I really enjoyed this era of TNA, but we all know how messy that all turned out. Somehow the company still kept its head above water with the Anthem takeover, and cue the savior, Jeff Jarrett and the Global Force Wrestling merger, which lasted all of a few months before changing its name *again*, this time to simply Impact Wrestling and finally doing away with the ridiculous, juvenile TNA moniker.

lu,2020-09-01,5.0," ""Once the hot new thing, this promotion/TV show derailed pretty quickly. LU has never shunned to market itself as a story-driven TV series just as much as a pro wrestling show and, for a while, it succeeded as both: the two first seasons built a gritty, almost B-movie-like world around some familiar faces and soon-to-be globally famous superstars, which served its purpose as a background to some formidable in-ring action. But then, season 3 came in and LU was already becoming plagued with problems behind the scenes regarding production, contracts and a turmoiled relationship with AAA. All of this reflected into the product: the main storylines were getting more convoluted, side-storylines were getting pointless at best and borderline stupid at worst, wrestlers came and went without (kayfabe) rhyme or reason and the in-ring action was reduced to spotfests that seemed to have little to no planning behind them (considering a good part of the roster had low morale and/or had little time to record their parts by then, it's somewhat justified). By season 4, not only the reduced budget and lawsuits had already made the show unsustainable, but the booking, the storylines and the matches were getting even worse. While many pleaded for a 5th season and the more optimistic even thought there was a way to make LU return to its glory days, the harsh truth is the show was beyond saving by that point. Ironically, what made LU special in the begining was it's curse at its end: hardly any storyline had a satisfying resolution, either feeling rushed or stepping into a cliffhanger. In that regard, LU, nowadays, is actually praised more for what they tried to do than what they actually accomplished: you'll see a lot of people complimenting them for implementing kayfabe-heavy storylines, but not the actual pay-offs to those. And the sad thing is all of that could be mostly forgiven, if they at least had strong booking and matches to make-up for it, but they weren't faring better as a pro wrestling show either. Now, one of their executive producers has expressed his desire of rebooting the entire show if they ever got a season 5 - while there is no possibility of a new season ever happening by this point, I would love to see a spiritual successor for that show in another network, with entirely new wrestlers, new storylines and even a new setting (as long as the team has learned from their mistakes, that is).""",Not a Mark,once the hot new thing this promotiontv show derailed pretty quickly lu has never shunned to market itself as a storydriven tv series just as much as a pro wrestling show and for a while it succeeded as both the two first seasons built a gritty almost bmovielike world around some familiar faces and soontobe globally famous superstars which served its purpose as a background to some formidable inring action but then season came in and lu was already becoming plagued with problems behind the scenes regarding production contracts and a turmoiled relationship with aaa all of this reflected into the product the main storylines were getting more convoluted sidestorylines were getting pointless at best and borderline stupid at worst wrestlers came and went without kayfabe rhyme or reason and the inring action was reduced to spotfests that seemed to have little to no planning behind them considering a good part of the roster had low morale andor had little time to record their parts by then its somewhat justified by season not only the reduced budget and lawsuits had already made the show unsustainable but the booking the storylines and the matches were getting even worse while many pleaded for a season and the more optimistic even thought there was a way to make lu return to its glory days the harsh truth is the show was beyond saving by that point ironically what made lu special in the begining was its curse at its end hardly any storyline had a satisfying resolution either feeling rushed or stepping into a cliffhanger in that regard lu nowadays is actually praised more for what they tried to do than what they actually accomplished youll see a lot of people complimenting them for implementing kayfabeheavy storylines but not the actual payoffs to those and the sad thing is all of that could be mostly forgiven if they at least had strong booking and matches to makeup for it but they werent faring better as a pro wrestling show either now one of their executive producers has expressed his desire of rebooting the entire show if they ever got a season  while there is no possibility of a new season ever happening by this point i would love to see a spiritual successor for that show in another network with entirely new wrestlers new storylines and even a new setting as long as the team has learned from their mistakes that is,409

This is also the strong roster, because Lu took over a market that was hardly used in the US, the Mexican wrestling, with which they have many large established stars like Aerostar, Drago, Texano El Patron, great legends like Chavo, Blue Demon Jr. or Dr. Wagner Jr. could also have new stars and new gimmicks have built like Pentagon, Fenix, King Cuerno, Prince Puma O The Mil Muertes. This radian is simply ingenious and accordingly strong are the matches. In almost every episode there is a very strong match and the big matches delivered almost everyone. Although wrestling technically, there is a lot of Spotwrestling, which is also wearing after some time, but still they could reinvent himself again and again. The feuds and stories are also awesome and large storystreams with complex characters such as Dario Cueto, Matanza or Mil Muertes and Catrina were brilliantly implemented with many strong filmically mounted video clips.

lu,2015-11-27,5.0,"""I've looked at some Lucha Underground Shows and I'm pretty blubbed. The problem is not the wrestler that is pretty good no question. My problem is rather that the league has a big problem with the pace of your shows. After Three high-speed matches one behind the other with partially incredible spots I am personally saturated, instead a Lucha Libre comes to the other after another. I have nothing against spot residues in herself, but you have to sometime sometimes put in a snap break, a story in one Tell a mess or at least a little slower. Only high-speed is very fast. In addition, the league in terms of hardcore matches probably wrote to the WSX at that time. So hardcore as possible and so fast S goes without the Actually, spots actually have to be done and thus telling a story. In a way, Lucha Underground is like the WSX, very good action but is too fast, when one is excited in the longer term. Conclusion So: The league does not exist now for so long, so she still has enough time from the mistakes I see right now. If that works, then I go significantly higher with the rating, because wrestling technically is what the guys are partially bringing a big cinema. """,Not a Mark,ive looked at some lucha underground shows and im pretty blubbed the problem is not the wrestler that is pretty good no question my problem is rather that the league has a big problem with the pace of your shows after three highspeed matches one behind the other with partially incredible spots i am personally saturated instead a lucha libre comes to the other after another i have nothing against spot residues in herself but you have to sometime sometimes put in a snap break a story in one tell a mess or at least a little slower only highspeed is very fast in addition the league in terms of hardcore matches probably wrote to the wsx at that time so hardcore as possible and so fast s goes without the actually spots actually have to be done and thus telling a story in a way lucha underground is like the wsx very good action but is too fast when one is excited in the longer term conclusion so the league does not exist now for so long so she still has enough time from the mistakes i see right now if that works then i go significantly higher with the rating because wrestling technically is what the guys are partially bringing a big cinema,215

The current G1 Climax tournament was probably the weakest ever in terms of overall quality. The structure of the NJPW show is terrible, with almost all of the matches being severely delayed due to the stupid ""only 5-6 matches per show"" scheme. Even the marketing is bad in today's NJPW, because someone in management decided that doing 1000 of the same ""road to"" shows a month and making all the PPVs two days long is a great idea!

Evil took the main title, the matches for the poor statuette of Yano, and there were many extremely unpleasant moments, but I still gave this company a chance and believed that the G1 season was an opportunity to apologize to the fans who had been suffering for a very long time. Everything started as usual, there were good matches, there were weak matches. I especially note that for a while we believed that Zach would be able to reach the final. Another great race is held by Cobb and it's really nice for him, he is very hardworking and almost all of his matches were not ashamed and disgusting to watch. But what happened next... Gedo decided to return Okada to greatness and did it in the most terrible way. Until recently, Okada was weak, losing to Cobb, but as G1 began, Okada began to roll around the block. And it would be fine if he lost 1-2 matches and took the block confidently, but no. It was the perfect moment to give defeat to Okada in the match with Taichi, but damn it, and Taichi was put under this Great Japanese Car. And then he loses to Tonga. And in another block, especially after Naito's injury, it seemed for a while that there was finally a new face in the final, but no. They gave the fourth final to Ibushi. I'm not upset, I'm disappointed. I fell so in love with Japanese wrestling at one time, but today, he just left me no choice.

njpw,2021-08-03,8.0," ""NJPW has a very mixed history: even in the Inoki age there was a lot of shitty matches to go through and the undercard was next to non-existent. The main events were usually quite good: Inoki is a extremely talented wrestler and was a massive draw in his heyday: but they didn't really have anything for the future, especially with Inoki refusing to put anyone over as his successor. They got better (ish) in the 90's when guys like Muto and such showed up but there was still a lot of BS, a lot of long, over-extended main events with little purpose done purely to cater to the AJPW style. This style has continued all the way up to the modern day, where there's still a lot of main event bouts paced around 15 minutes of loose and inconsequential grappling before actually kicking into gear, Okada in particular lends himself well to this method. It's also meant that I've never really enjoyed most of their product beyond the mid 2010's where they'd have some really amazing G1 shows and astonishing matches. As a company, it's clearly got issues, even before the last year or so: no focus on the tag division, a weak undercard, overreliance on forced ""epic"" bouts, etc. NJPW might seem like the best in the world when you've started off but it quickly gets overshadowed by NOAH and AJPW in terms of cards and talent when you've actually dove into the wrestling there. NJPW has always had one, big issue: the main event is all they focus on and as such, they try to make it as fancy as possible, as long as possible, everything to excess. This style works when you have guys who thrive under it (Okada and Omega for instance) but it doesn't do the trick for everyone else. It's never been ""the best"" it's always played second fiddle to AJPW in the 90's, and NOAH in the 2000's.

njpw,2020-12-02,6.0," ""New Japan has always been a promotion about Aces. The tag team division, mid-card, and low-card has hardly made sense here for the past ten or twenty years. People came to look at the main eventers and those who are as close to them as possible and for whom the lower positions are only a temporary measure for hardening and full-fledged entry into the main league. I put up with it a lot, and as a big fan of Tomohiro Ishii, it was hard for me to be content with just the perfection of the top stories, but if you look back and remember the reign of Okada, the rise of Omega, the story of Naito and the breaking the templates from Jay White, it's not surprising that it's so great that other shortcomings look just insignificant. New Japan has never been perfect, but their main stories are so good that this fact is not taken seriously. But 2020 is a crazy year for the whole planet, and for NJPW it was really a turning point, because all the stories that were written for it, have undergone superficial changes, but were squeezed into this framework, when there were no events for several months, but you need to urgently do something so that the wrestlers don't stand still. I always thought Gedo was a pretty overrated booker, but his work this year proved to me that he is not only overrated, but also terrible. The highlight of the promotion in the form of the main events could no longer be riveted as before, because the entire champion race of Naito was spoiled by EVIL, the stupid bet on the Kota Ibushi continues, and only Jay White in all this bacchanalia looks valuable and logical character, but you can't keep it all on him alone. There are still Tanahashi, Taichi, sabre and Ishii, but they are in a place that means nothing, and watching mid-carders, in my sad experience, is too hard here, because their booking is empty and uninteresting - they always stand still and continue to spin from year to year in these conditions, like a chicken on a spit. I would say that I might reconsider my assessment in the future, but here and now New Japan has lost my interest in its product - for the first time in many years, I really don't care what happens there and who else takes IWGP Heavyweight Championship. They didn't even give Ishii the Intercontinental championship, but EVIL went with two titles at once. The fact that Naito himself complains about this situation - no one cares, seeing the consistently high ratings on this site.

The wrestlers are not out for themselves to make the most money, and the owners are not out to control every aspect of every detail. A collective effort is made by the locker room to protect the concept of a hierarchy of wrestling moves, going from opening strikes to flashy finishing sequences. This is showcased through every card through most every match, from the opening Young Lions (and projects like Lion's Gate) submitting to Half Crabs to Main Eventers protecting their finishers as legitimate killers.

They say they're going to come back in April next year but I strongly doubt it and even if they do' It won't be the same. The reason I say this is simple. If ECW was the blueprint of a modern-day indie promotion, ROH was the one that refined it. At one point, they had perhaps the most talented roster in all of professional wrestling. Look at some of the names that were in the promotion: AJ Styles, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, The Young Bucks, Kevin Steen, El Generico, Austin Aries, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Tyler Black, Adam Cole. That's an all-star cast. All of them have gone on to find great success not just in WWE, but in AEW, Impact, and NJPW. Like with ECW, they were the cool alternative to WWE but they went in an entirely different approach, focusing on smaller guys with heart and skill and portraying it more as a sport than a 'sport that entertains'. This worked perfectly and it helped that the 'smart' wrestling fandom was steadily growing by this time. That's why their demise is an absolute blow to the wrestling industry. It represents the end of an era. ROH was the father of the modern independent scene and it led the way for other promotions like PWG, CZW, EVOLVE and so many others to be created. Not only that, they managed to change how WWE does business, bringing in a lot of their top guys and turning them into legit headliners. For their contributions to wrestling, I believe it's only fair that they get the highest possible rating.
