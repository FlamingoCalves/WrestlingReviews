However, the big problem with some of those matches is their formulaic forced epic nature (Stardom also has this problem). The excuse given is, the audience has a different understanding of the human psychology. It gets pretty lame, not exactly the place for so many charismatic global stars. I want to emphasize: Their production style, even for a big company, makes the most sense for wrestling. Wrestling is more like theater, so you don't need like a dozen freakin' cameras to show how much money you got, and no cutting between them every freakin' second as if the audience has ADHD. Even though I hate when wrestlers illogically spam moves like crazy (and I'll never understand the german 'no-sell'), I still prefer the directing style which makes everything more enjoyable as a result. This is the main reason it's ahead of other promotions that use too many camera tricks, causing TV sea sickness. And the vibe is pretty freaking great too, by feeling chill/not rude but also picking up with excitement at the appropriate times.""",Mark,is this modern era shin nihon overrated definitely but still the best singles matches youll ever see i dont care what anyone else says however the big problem with some of those matches is their formulaic forced epic nature stardom also has this problem the excuse given is the audience has a different understanding of the human psychology it gets pretty lame not exactly the place for so many charismatic global stars i want to emphasize their production style even for a big company makes the most sense for wrestling wrestling is more like theater so you dont need like a dozen freakin cameras to show how much money you got and no cutting between them every freakin second as if the audience has adhd even though i hate when wrestlers illogically spam moves like crazy and ill never understand the german nosell i still prefer the directing style which makes everything more enjoyable as a result this is the main reason its ahead of other promotions that use too many camera tricks causing tv sea sickness and the vibe is pretty freaking great too by feeling chillnot rude but also picking up with excitement at the appropriate times,199

Then the obvious problems began, but I expected everything to work out. Then everything became much worse and it severely knocked me down, but now I understand that the NJPW has rotted. A lot of people talked about the countless number of problems in all divisions and with almost all wrestlers, so it makes no sense to repeat it. The main problem is that the creative team led by Gedo doesn't care about their own product. Gedo obviously wrote out, he lacks ideas, courage and resilience to, for example, refuse Dick Togo with his bad ideas.

Their archives from the late 2000s to the late 2010s are still the best and most beloved thing I've ever seen in professional wrestling. But I believe that active promotions should be judged by their current state of affairs. And at this point, NJPW sucks. This company was known for its incredible performers, interesting storylines, and logical and consistent booking. And most of the important matches were at such a high level that no one could have the slightest doubt as to which company was now #1 in the world. But now NJPW has none of that left. Their booking is terrible, uninteresting, and often inconsistent and illogical. Pushing Evil into the main event has been a complete failure and has only resulted in a drain on the audience and a drop in interest in the company. The decision to unify the two main titles and introduce a new world championship was probably the worst idea in the company's history. Kota Ibushi failed as the company's Ace, his matches are strange, and his character is empty and lifeless. It especially pains me to write this, since he was my favorite wrestler once. The current G1 Climax tournament was probably the weakest ever in terms of overall quality. The structure of the NJPW show is terrible, with almost all of the matches being severely delayed due to the stupid ""only 5-6 matches per show"" scheme. Even the marketing is bad in today's NJPW, because someone in management decided that doing 1000 of the same ""road to"" shows a month and making all the PPVs two days long is a great idea! I didn't want to downgrade because of this company's really GREAT past, but I have to. I just died, died in the piss. Just death, death from hell. I just fell down.

Everything started as usual, there were good matches, there were weak matches. I especially note that for a while we believed that Zach would be able to reach the final. Another great race is held by Cobb and it's really nice for him, he is very hardworking and almost all of his matches were not ashamed and disgusting to watch. But what happened next... Gedo decided to return Okada to greatness and did it in the most terrible way. Until recently, Okada was weak, losing to Cobb, but as G1 began, Okada began to roll around the block. And it would be fine if he lost 1-2 matches and took the block confidently, but no. It was the perfect moment to give defeat to Okada in the match with Taichi, but damn it, and Taichi was put under this Great Japanese Car. And then he loses to Tonga. And in another block, especially after Naito's injury, it seemed for a while that there was finally a new face in the final, but no. They gave the fourth final to Ibushi.

2021-08-03,8.0," ""NJPW has a very mixed history: even in the Inoki age there was a lot of shitty matches to go through and the undercard was next to non-existent. The main events were usually quite good: Inoki is a extremely talented wrestler and was a massive draw in his heyday: but they didn't really have anything for the future, especially with Inoki refusing to put anyone over as his successor. They got better (ish) in the 90's when guys like Muto and such showed up but there was still a lot of BS, a lot of long, over-extended main events with little purpose done purely to cater to the AJPW style. This style has continued all the way up to the modern day, where there's still a lot of main event bouts paced around 15 minutes of loose and inconsequential grappling before actually kicking into gear, Okada in particular lends himself well to this method. It's also meant that I've never really enjoyed most of their product beyond the mid 2010's where they'd have some really amazing G1 shows and astonishing matches. As a company, it's clearly got issues, even before the last year or so: no focus on the tag division, a weak undercard, overreliance on forced ""epic"" bouts, etc. NJPW might seem like the best in the world when you've started off but it quickly gets overshadowed by NOAH and AJPW in terms of cards and talent when you've actually dove into the wrestling there. NJPW has always had one, big issue: the main event is all they focus on and as such, they try to make it as fancy as possible, as long as possible, everything to excess. This style works when you have guys who thrive under it (Okada and Omega for instance) but it doesn't do the trick for everyone else. It's never been ""the best"" it's always played second fiddle to AJPW in the 90's, and NOAH in the 2000's.

2020-12-02,6.0," ""New Japan has always been a promotion about Aces. The tag team division, mid-card, and low-card has hardly made sense here for the past ten or twenty years. People came to look at the main eventers and those who are as close to them as possible and for whom the lower positions are only a temporary measure for hardening and full-fledged entry into the main league. I put up with it a lot, and as a big fan of Tomohiro Ishii, it was hard for me to be content with just the perfection of the top stories, but if you look back and remember the reign of Okada, the rise of Omega, the story of Naito and the breaking the templates from Jay White, it's not surprising that it's so great that other shortcomings look just insignificant. New Japan has never been perfect, but their main stories are so good that this fact is not taken seriously. But 2020 is a crazy year for the whole planet, and for NJPW it was really a turning point, because all the stories that were written for it, have undergone superficial changes, but were squeezed into this framework, when there were no events for several months, but you need to urgently do something so that the wrestlers don't stand still. I always thought Gedo was a pretty overrated booker, but his work this year proved to me that he is not only overrated, but also terrible. The highlight of the promotion in the form of the main events could no longer be riveted as before, because the entire champion race of Naito was spoiled by EVIL, the stupid bet on the Kota Ibushi continues, and only Jay White in all this bacchanalia looks valuable and logical character, but you can't keep it all on him alone. There are still Tanahashi, Taichi, sabre and Ishii, but they are in a place that means nothing, and watching mid-carders, in my sad experience, is too hard here, because their booking is empty and uninteresting - they always stand still and continue to spin from year to year in these conditions, like a chicken on a spit. I would say that I might reconsider my assessment in the future, but here and now New Japan has lost my interest in its product - for the first time in many years, I really don't care what happens there and who else takes IWGP Heavyweight Championship. They didn't even give Ishii the Intercontinental championship, but EVIL went with two titles at once. The fact that Naito himself complains about this situation - no one cares, seeing the consistently high ratings on this site.

2018-06-18,9.0," ""New Japan is all about protecting wrestling as an artform first and foremost. The wrestlers are not out for themselves to make the most money, and the owners are not out to control every aspect of every detail. A collective effort is made by the locker room to protect the concept of a hierarchy of wrestling moves, going from opening strikes to flashy finishing sequences. This is showcased through every card through most every match, from the opening Young Lions (and projects like Lion's Gate) submitting to Half Crabs to Main Eventers protecting their finishers as legitimate killers. This concept of hierarchy also shows in respect towards weight classes (which has lessened in later years) and the way wrestlers are booked to make the most out of their current situations. Multi-man tags manage to represent the roster well while still keeping most workers fresh and safe, while singles matches are kept as special occasions deserving of proper focus. The breaks and pauses between shows and tours are intended to let workers heal, enabling them to go all out with less to worry about, when they are on the big stage. All development and progression happens slowly with rare exceptions, yet it feels like there is constantly something going on and at the same time, brewing beneath the status quo. The energy and strength of the roster is an effort decades in building, and continues as a tribute to the great showcase of pro wrestling as a competitive comparable to sport. New Japan, to me, equals a love for wrestling, because they enable the workers to bring their absolute best night in, night out, the most out of all promotions.""",Mark,new japan is all about protecting wrestling as an artform first and foremost the wrestlers are not out for themselves to make the most money and the owners are not out to control every aspect of every detail a collective effort is made by the locker room to protect the concept of a hierarchy of wrestling moves going from opening strikes to flashy finishing sequences this is showcased through every card through most every match from the opening young lions and projects like lions gate submitting to half crabs to main eventers protecting their finishers as legitimate killers this concept of hierarchy also shows in respect towards weight classes which has lessened in later years and the way wrestlers are booked to make the most out of their current situations multiman tags manage to represent the roster well while still keeping most workers fresh and safe while singles matches are kept as special occasions deserving of proper focus the breaks and pauses between shows and tours are intended to let workers heal enabling them to go all out with less to worry about when they are on the big stage all development and progression happens slowly with rare exceptions yet it feels like there is constantly something going on and at the same time brewing beneath the status quo the energy and strength of the roster is an effort decades in building and continues as a tribute to the great showcase of pro wrestling as a competitive comparable to sport new japan to me equals a love for wrestling because they enable the workers to bring their absolute best night in night out the most out of all promotions,279
