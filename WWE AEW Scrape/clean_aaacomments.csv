Triplemania Regia showed that AAA is still a mess, even when they have shows with fans. 2021 was a sad year for this promotion, with many TV tapings being in front of nobody (COVID restrictions), and the material from those tapings seems to live in a parallel universe, with regards to the big events. There's still too much of a reliance on old names, and the heel side is currently too heavy. On top of that, it has to be said - Konnan is creatively bankrupt in today's wrestling. He loves his usual swerves and outdated xenophobic tropes, but this stuff has been done to death. Especially the ""someone comes out with babyface only to betray him immediately"" bit. It's sad because there is talent, and this promotion was in a position to deliver a knockout blow to CMLL, but instead, AAA's Triplemania Regia only proved that both promotions have serious problems. Hell, at least CMLL is slowly building new stars, and got to play with NJPW and Ice Ribbon talents, even if only for a bit. They even made women main event. AAA is mainly Konnan's wild ride, with El Hijo del Vikingo as the current top champion, and the Muñoz family coming in to spice things up near the top of the card.
