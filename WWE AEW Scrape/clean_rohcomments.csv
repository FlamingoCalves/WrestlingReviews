They say they're going to come back in April next year but I strongly doubt it and even if they do' It won't be the same. The reason I say this is simple. If ECW was the blueprint of a modern-day indie promotion, ROH was the one that refined it. At one point, they had perhaps the most talented roster in all of professional wrestling. Look at some of the names that were in the promotion: AJ Styles, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, The Young Bucks, Kevin Steen, El Generico, Austin Aries, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Tyler Black, Adam Cole. That's an all-star cast. All of them have gone on to find great success not just in WWE, but in AEW, Impact, and NJPW. Like with ECW, they were the cool alternative to WWE but they went in an entirely different approach, focusing on smaller guys with heart and skill and portraying it more as a sport than a 'sport that entertains'. This worked perfectly and it helped that the 'smart' wrestling fandom was steadily growing by this time. That's why their demise is an absolute blow to the wrestling industry. It represents the end of an era. ROH was the father of the modern independent scene and it led the way for other promotions like PWG, CZW, EVOLVE and so many others to be created. Not only that, they managed to change how WWE does business, bringing in a lot of their top guys and turning them into legit headliners. For their contributions to wrestling, I believe it's only fair that they get the highest possible rating.

2019-09-18,6.0,"""Update // RoHS influence on today's US mainstream wrestling is huge. The match quality of the early years is considerably strong and the number of classics absolutely immense. But the wedding of the league is unfortunately loosely over 10 years ago. Also document the evaluations in the Matchguide and the events. The time of highlights is over. The events become more, but in total much weaker and interchangeable. You do not produce any self-plants, but in the highly contested market behind the WWE much too often the look. Whether now compared to the US Indys or just NJPW. Despite partnership, a real competition has grown here, which is currently causing the rusted problems. If the partnership has been for years for boredom and idealessness for the booking, the talents hike sometimes permanently to Japan. Offspring is not produced. Real Draws with exclusive contracts are barely available. All title pictures have become boring in 2018. di E Negative tendency from 2017 unfortunately continued. The further high output in the context of the Honor Club Introduction also ensures that you slip into the redundancy. Hardly recognizable with these shows, highlights set maximum the Bucks, PAGE, Lethal or guest worker from Japan. That's too little, if raw wants to make the next step forward again.
