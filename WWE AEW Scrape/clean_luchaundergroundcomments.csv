2020-09-01,5.0," ""Once the hot new thing, this promotion/TV show derailed pretty quickly. LU has never shunned to market itself as a story-driven TV series just as much as a pro wrestling show and, for a while, it succeeded as both: the two first seasons built a gritty, almost B-movie-like world around some familiar faces and soon-to-be globally famous superstars, which served its purpose as a background to some formidable in-ring action. But then, season 3 came in and LU was already becoming plagued with problems behind the scenes regarding production, contracts and a turmoiled relationship with AAA. All of this reflected into the product: the main storylines were getting more convoluted, side-storylines were getting pointless at best and borderline stupid at worst, wrestlers came and went without (kayfabe) rhyme or reason and the in-ring action was reduced to spotfests that seemed to have little to no planning behind them (considering a good part of the roster had low morale and/or had little time to record their parts by then, it's somewhat justified). By season 4, not only the reduced budget and lawsuits had already made the show unsustainable, but the booking, the storylines and the matches were getting even worse. While many pleaded for a 5th season and the more optimistic even thought there was a way to make LU return to its glory days, the harsh truth is the show was beyond saving by that point. Ironically, what made LU special in the begining was it's curse at its end: hardly any storyline had a satisfying resolution, either feeling rushed or stepping into a cliffhanger. In that regard, LU, nowadays, is actually praised more for what they tried to do than what they actually accomplished: you'll see a lot of people complimenting them for implementing kayfabe-heavy storylines, but not the actual pay-offs to those. And the sad thing is all of that could be mostly forgiven, if they at least had strong booking and matches to make-up for it, but they weren't faring better as a pro wrestling show either. Now, one of their executive producers has expressed his desire of rebooting the entire show if they ever got a season 5 - while there is no possibility of a new season ever happening by this point, I would love to see a spiritual successor for that show in another network, with entirely new wrestlers, new storylines and even a new setting (as long as the team has learned from their mistakes, that is).""",Not a Mark,once the hot new thing this promotiontv show derailed pretty quickly lu has never shunned to market itself as a storydriven tv series just as much as a pro wrestling show and for a while it succeeded as both the two first seasons built a gritty almost bmovielike world around some familiar faces and soontobe globally famous superstars which served its purpose as a background to some formidable inring action but then season came in and lu was already becoming plagued with problems behind the scenes regarding production contracts and a turmoiled relationship with aaa all of this reflected into the product the main storylines were getting more convoluted sidestorylines were getting pointless at best and borderline stupid at worst wrestlers came and went without kayfabe rhyme or reason and the inring action was reduced to spotfests that seemed to have little to no planning behind them considering a good part of the roster had low morale andor had little time to record their parts by then its somewhat justified by season not only the reduced budget and lawsuits had already made the show unsustainable but the booking the storylines and the matches were getting even worse while many pleaded for a season and the more optimistic even thought there was a way to make lu return to its glory days the harsh truth is the show was beyond saving by that point ironically what made lu special in the begining was its curse at its end hardly any storyline had a satisfying resolution either feeling rushed or stepping into a cliffhanger in that regard lu nowadays is actually praised more for what they tried to do than what they actually accomplished youll see a lot of people complimenting them for implementing kayfabeheavy storylines but not the actual payoffs to those and the sad thing is all of that could be mostly forgiven if they at least had strong booking and matches to makeup for it but they werent faring better as a pro wrestling show either now one of their executive producers has expressed his desire of rebooting the entire show if they ever got a season  while there is no possibility of a new season ever happening by this point i would love to see a spiritual successor for that show in another network with entirely new wrestlers new storylines and even a new setting as long as the team has learned from their mistakes that is,409

2015-04-22,8.0,"""Lu properly rated is difficult. And for different reasons. First of all, you should not expect classic Lucha Libre as you get it at CMLL. LU is very entertainment for AAA ratios. The format comes as a kind of Series presented. I only know from MTV's Wrestling Society-X, and that was, because you can be honest, garbage. Here you realize the people of El Rey try to go the golden middle ground. Fast matches like in Lucha Libre, Storytelling as in the US Main Stream Wrestling paired with elements of hispanic American culture (everyday culture as music, as well as the influences of the Aztecs, etc.). I'm thrilled here that you can create it from an hour (Eig. 45 min) TV time To get remove maximum. There are no matches without meaning, which is a very clear advantage over many other promotion, and the workers really troubles to transport everything. All in all, I like despite Ma Ner small chop the total product. Lucha Underground is what the WWE likes to be claimed by itself: Sports Entertainment. And I still feel talking to each show. Too bad that there is no tour, pity that the fan shop has previously shipped only in North America (of course, that may only be a valuation criterion, but can be added to the overall package), too bad the tapings are always made so far before. But all in all, the ""product"" is really his 8/10 worth. Thumbs up. Hopefully, it stays permanently preserved as a real alternative to other shows.

2015-03-26,9.0," ""Certainly one of the most intriguing new promotions to come along in many years (perhaps even - dare I say it - since ECW).  Quickly established itself with an innovative, more cinematic approach, with backstage segments playing out as mini-movies rather than standard wrestling ""reality-style"" segments.  No doubt the influence of co-founder Robert Rodriguez.  Great mix of talent from AAA in Mexico as well as the US independent scene.  They combine lucha libre tradition with new-school mentality in a totally successful way, and create interesting and high-quality matches, often with interesting new stipulations or twists on old favorites (i. e. their version of the Royal Rumble, the Aztec Warfare match).  All the while it creates its own mythology for its characters.  Bringing something truly new to wrestling is no small feat and Lucha Underground pulls it off.  Rated 9 currently as the company is still less than a year old, but if they keep doing what they're doing I could definitely see myself scoring even higher.""",Mark,certainly one of the most intriguing new promotions to come along in many years perhaps even dare i say it since ecw quickly established itself with an innovative more cinematic approach with backstage segments playing out as minimovies rather than standard wrestling realitystyle segments no doubt the influence of cofounder robert rodriguez great mix of talent from aaa in mexico as well as the us independent scene they combine lucha libre tradition with newschool mentality in a totally successful way and create interesting and highquality matches often with interesting new stipulations or twists on old favorites i e their version of the royal rumble the aztec warfare match all the while it creates its own mythology for its characters bringing something truly new to wrestling is no small feat and lucha underground pulls it off rated currently as the company is still less than a year old but if they keep doing what theyre doing i could definitely see myself scoring even higher,163

I hope that this shipment quickly increases popularity, so that it will be a good alternative to the WWE. Remains only to hope that the McMahons remains League do not try to be sawing, because the WWE is like the Empire of Star Wars for me. At the moment I really like NXT in this league. At Lucha everything is somehow crazy, even more athletic and somehow Mafia Like. I find this mix very much successful. However, the storylines must be greatly improved. Good wrestlers are already there and I hope there will be even more. Nice that you also get a few well-known former WWE Stars to face. I could also get a Matt Hardy very well Imagine Lucha. Especially with his Willow Gimmick he would have fit perfectly. TNA Wrestling is a setting star. I saw the start at destination America and I just have D As feeling that from this league is just the air out. Stars like Bully Ray or Devon have left the league and not without reason.

2014-12-20,8.0,"""Welcome to Lucha Underground! When I experienced from the program almost half a year ago and I watched a few shows from AAA because of this (whom everyone can do for free because the gentlemen of AAA publish the shows after almost 2- 3 weeks on your YouTube page) was my first skeptical. The product was Crazy as fuck. There was many interesting faces that you get to face here again (Drago, Fenix, Sexy Star) but also if I found the shows really cool Was it so much shit at once that after a month I said, ""Ok, let's start with this Ami Show because otherwise I need N new brain. ""But I was a bit worried how to sell the product of AAA in America and to make it open to tell you either. Lucha Underground is what completely own. It is best to describe Lu as Attitude Era on Crack. The stories are in the Center It's all very over the top and the wrestlers are really displayed like superheroes or something like that. But that has a cool charm. The backstage segments are more reminiscent of a mafia movie wherever the whole thing is more like a kind of TV series. The promos are also really well done. Especially the wrestlers are tallly crossed. Sexy star as a perfect role model for the female viewers, Prince Puma as a mysterious student of Konnan and Muerme or as an absolute monster Ala Bane von Batman. The feuds are also correct Well done. The feud between King Guerno and Drago is already better than all matches between Cena and Lesnar. The in-ring action goes in ordn University Fast Spotwrestling with many moves a suction cup conductor match. The mix fits. For fans of classic wrestling not necessarily but all the one of a good mix of story-telling and fast-paced action I can only say I can say. Let's see what the future for Lu brings for the first but 8 points.

2014-12-17,9.0,"""So far I am very entertained by Lucha Underground. The production and setting in the"" Aztec Temple ""are a nice idea, whereby the real highlight is for me to raise a wrestling show like a TV series with short but extremely high quality produced backstage players who can cover the lack of actress talent of many wrestlers. The same applies to the camera guide during the matches, which allows smaller botches mostly to ignore. The producer has made something that the wrestling industry has been missing for a long time and what I was hardly hardly held for possible: to bring innovation to the American market. Further plus is the short show duration of 45 minutes send time. So one is forced to take a relatively high pace, on the other hand, you can also be the whole refunds Save the otherwise wrestling shows. Nevertheless, you can do it Rotz the short time to establish characters, further develop and thus ensure that I am interested in how it continues. Pleasant variety to 9 hours WWE product per week.
