Their roster has been ransacked by much larger promotions and they have very few stars remaining. TNA's best years were from about 2003-2008, where during that period they were unquestionably better than WWE. However once Vince Russo and his boys joined, it quickly fell off a cliff and turned into WCW-lite, and became literally unwatchable, illogical, tasteless garbage. Things got better once they all left, but Impact took a long time to recover, and they are still feeling the damage. At least at a glance, Impact is a shell of the company it used to be. The company that once produced fantastic television every week, pioneered the X-Division, and introduced the likes of AJ Styles, Chris Daniels, Samoa Joe and many others to mainstream audiences is now practically irrelevant, only surviving due to partnerships with larger companies, brand deals and the fact that their parent company owns the TV network they air on. Now it even struggles to draw in 100, 000 viewers every week, when just a few years ago it easily pulled over a million.

NWA:TNA was, to be blunt, absolute garbage for the first couple years, aside from guys like Jerry Lynn and AJ Styles and Low Ki carrying the company on their backs with the X-Division. But as the years went by it slowly shifted away from being a carbon copy of WCW's twilight years to some actually very good programming by the late 00's. Then Hogan showed up. Like Bryan Alvarez famously said, TNA for some reason decided to hire all the people on the cover of The Death of WCW book. The Hogan/Bischoff experiment simply didn't work, mostly for the same reason WCW was really only popular and successful for about two or three years before it all fell apart. Then you had the Aces and Eights saga, which started off great but fizzled out with a whimper. Then the money issues really started happening and TNA seemed to be at risk of going out of business on almost a weekly basis. Billy Corgan, of all people, wound up taking the show over and honestly I really enjoyed this era of TNA, but we all know how messy that all turned out. Somehow the company still kept its head above water with the Anthem takeover, and cue the savior, Jeff Jarrett and the Global Force Wrestling merger, which lasted all of a few months before changing its name *again*, this time to simply Impact Wrestling and finally doing away with the ridiculous, juvenile TNA moniker. And then, finally, we have Don Callis and Scott D'Amore, who were able to get this company onto its feet again and produce relatively good programming on a consistent basis.
