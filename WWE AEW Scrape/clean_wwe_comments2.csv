They are completely out of touch with the fans and with the current releases they must be awful to work for today. Even NXT, which was one of it's best shows has had a terrible revamp. Every time I try and watch a Raw episode today I just find the whole product insulatingly bad. Historically this would have easily been a 10 because for all the bad there was just so many iconic moments like Hogan slamming Andre, Austin v McMahon pushing the envelope, the countless classics from wrestlers like Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels etc. Wrestlemania was THE show every star wanted to be a part of.

WWE has a lot of rich history and produced so many memories throughout so many decades, from the Buddy Rogers era to the Ruthless Aggression era. But since the start of the PG era, the WWE has been a downward spiral of nonsense that no one can figure out. The saving grace to WWE was NXT, spearheaded by Triple H, and this brand really came into it's own in 2013 and up until 2021, NXT was on fire, and had the world talking.. and now the word is that Vince McMahon has decided to step in and completely change everything that Triple H has built. That is a FAIL. NXT will now look similar to the TRASH known as RAW & SmackDown, if that is the case. This could also mean that NXT UK may just now be in fact the WWE's best brand, but it is only a 1 hour weekly show on the WWE Network. LOL. WWE's new hiring process is also an eye opener, which means that the future of the company might just be TRASH as well, because WWE's built from scratch wrestlers are usually TRASH for the most part. Rarely do you get a Brock Lesnar, John Cena, The Rock, Kurt Angle, Trish Stratus, Charlotte Flair, Bianca Belair, etc. That is VERY rare.

2021-01-23,8.0,"""The WWF has socialized me (next to WCW) in terms of wrestling and, of course, swinging strongly with my perception in 2021. Many of my most intense wrestling experiences associate with the Wwe. Markout moments, live events, huge anticipation On PPVs, dermade nights, because the PPV had a horny card, Watch parties. All that I connect with the WWE and that's in part of exactly 2021 so. And then, in addition to all the problem that the market leader brings with it , Positioning at the US Entertainment Market still brings too much problems for me and that is generally a development that I see critically and often reduces my entertainment factor. The way away from Wrestling to the Sports Entertainment is from AG View comprehensible, but as a consumer, I'm not in the target group in many parts. But the WWE is so wide that you can get something for yourself 2021 and in the Main Roster is not all bad either. In general, in Stamford sit too many TV writer and too little wrestling heads. The focus on Sports Entertainment is always active in the center, which does not believe in my opinion. But to my scare are exactly the angles and people who produce YT-Clicks and Twitter hearts. Why should the WWE change it? People like Cornette then bring the 80s to the table and regret the dead of Kayfabe. I also conquer me, but it remains hypothetical if the (impossible) return could bring similar clicks. So I have to live with that people I think for very talented are external ones and are the focus of people who even move from the point of view of the WWE. As for the WWE as an employer in recent years, one can only see a positive positive and American capitalism and associated labor market is generally a problem. It can only be better. The production level converts between ingenious and artificial. But especially in artificiality, US sports have been a slightly different view of Support and of course, the WWE becomes more and more to the TV show and away from the spot sport, which should cause real emotions.

And if you still are not convinced that WWE is not the company that should represent pro wrestling in the world here are some other reasons: most of the wrestlers who either have been fired or demanded their release have explained stories that will make you not want to work for them, they do not let wrestlers evolve on their characters, cut their own promos and they have JBL under contract, someone who harassed a working partner of his.

2020-07-13,9.0," ""How on earth do I fairly review the WWE? Do I focus heavily on the questionable, childish booking that has become more prominent over the last ten years or so, or do I focus more on the company's prior 50 years of history? Do I focus more on the memories this company gave me? And the nightmares I got from watching a toothless Mankind smile his bloody gums at me after falling through a 20-foot structure, or from watching a 6'11 deadman set his co-workers ablaze? Perhaps I should think about the Golden Era, where Hulkamania was running wild and thousands of fans were packing into the Silverdome and the millions were watching around the world as the All American Hogan slammed a 500-pound giant. It's an impossible task. What stays consistent, however, is that in WWE, when it rains it pours, and when it shines, it doesn't get brighter. When WWE does good, whether that's a Hogan slamming an Andre or a Stone Cold giving the finger to the boss or more recently a Daniel Bryan fighting his way into the main event of Wrestlemania, it does great. Those moments feel so fulfilling to watch happen and no other wrestling company can fight that feeling. However, WWE is no stranger to dropping the ball and missing golden opportunities whether it's to create a five-star classic or to build a new star, WWE's booking has been questionable to the hardcore fans for years now, often to the point of sheer boredom from audiences. But, as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it makes those special moments whether it's a Daniel Bryan/Authority or Kofi Kingston/Daniel Bryan rivalry feel so much more special. But fans like myself feel so much more frustrated to see WWE drop the ball on a 'Rusev Day' or an NXT call up which, at this point, has become almost humorous as WWE has such a consistent history of burying their popular stars from their third brand. Another problem 2020 WWE faces is its sheer lack of ability to create new stars, almost all of the current stars of WWE found their success in other promotions like TNA or NJPW or ROH, most NXT stars come from Evolve instead of being Performance Centre homegrowns. And WWE also has a frustrating habit of putting its older, retired icons over their younger upcoming stars. The fact that the cover star of the upcoming WWE 2K Battlegrounds is Stone Cold Steve Austin, a man who hasn't wrestled since 2003, really speaks on WWE's star building credentials. But if we look away from today's WWE, you see all the timeless moments it has created over the last sixty years, some I've already named.

The future seems really bright with current stars like AJ Styles, Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Aleister Black, Daniel Bryan, Sasha Banks, Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt among others, and the matches they can put on from time to time are still great. Additionally, they have also been improving the quality of their PPVs.

In the 80s, they are the top promotion in the USA where I find the roster of the then NWA shows or the then resulting WCW far more interesting find. The first half of the 90s was very weak. However, the Attitude Era was one of the strongest phases of the promotion and offered very Utnerhondame moments, but less crass In Ring Action. However, this focus was less an innovation of the WWE as an answer to other leagues. The 2000s were just half pretty strong and probably the best phase of WWE story. That was mainly because you want to get the Roster from WWE , WCW and ECW had. In the end, however, the use of these, as always in WWE history, was disappointing. However, since 2007, the product has been steadily steadily and there is no End in sight. There is so much that disturbs me at the WWE, that would blow up the frame. Of course, there have been NXT since then, but the main shows pull the whole thing back so that NXT makes the rating hardly better. In addition, a call-up into the Main Roster is unfortunately sometimes a bit of which you are afraid, rather than you are looking forward to it. In general, you have to say that the WWE has never shown the best wrestling. Of course, they have produced outstanding wrestlers, but most of the really big wrestlers were bought and were not allowed to show their whole potential for a long time. And for years they have not exercised any more than solid wrestler. But that was never the strength of the WWE, which was much more creating the big moments, the big clashes between the over-stars.

2018-02-08,1.0," ""They're the biggest wrestling promotion in the world, and the place where countless memorable matches and moments have happened in its extensive history. It's also a shame that it has also had countless failures and let downs over its history, as well. Awful is the status quo in the WWE, with many moments of mediocrity, and brief glimpses of excellence that usually happen in spite of themselves. One major example of this was Daniel Bryan. He had become their biggest star more or less on his own; not out of some forced-down-your-throat, war-of-attrition case like Cena or Roman. And it's because he had connected to the audience in such a magnificent way, that they were forced to let him have his time to shine (regrettably, Bryan's time as a competitor is probably over). WWE's booking is consistently terrible, to the point where any time something exciting seems to happen, you have to ask not if, but when, and how they'll **** it up. Their writing is equally unbearable; no matter how charismatic their performers may be, they're forced to follow a hollow script of what their writing team thinks makes wrestlers who they are, and not allowing the wrestlers the freedom to express themselves and have them connect to the audience emotionally and authentically. No wrestler there feels special in the way a Hogan, Stone Cold or Rock did, and it's astounding to me how they managed that with a roster that has the likes of Nakamura, Owens, Zayn, Asuka, Styles and Lesnar. It's because even with that caliber of talent, their weekly shows are so routine and monotonous. They've failed on so many opportunities to make new stars, they've failed to bolster the ratings which steadily go down year after year, but apparently they still make a ton of money, so I guess business is good and everything is fine!

In addition, the league - as has been starting their history - on surprising booking decisions, short-term (often headless) resolutions of the stories and catapults in addition to Wrestler after strong subjective sense of taste to the top. Speculative economic decisions are about quality, which proves approximately the WWE title win of a Jinder Mahal, with which one wants to conquer the Indian market. Many talents have the review. Outputs like that of a Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes or Austin Aries will not remain individual symptoms in the long term. Added to That Part Timer, which means fast money for the league, always get the priority in front of the Main-Roster for the Main Event. Brock Lesnar as Universal Champion thus disappears well and like months from the shows. Hopping aid as the Womens Revolution turns out to be disappointment because behind the curtains do not believe enough of the old-established responsible persons - and short-handed a man gain the first women's money in the bank Ladder Match. Angering is likely to annoy the fans who are still emotionally invested in the product and ultimately feeling presented.
