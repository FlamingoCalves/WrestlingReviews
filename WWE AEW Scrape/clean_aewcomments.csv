If you don't like what wwe does, you might still enjoy the dub if you can shake off it's eerie wwe-like atmosphere one invariably encounters.

The promos are better but still somewhat forced/scripted at times, the stories aren't as laughable (some of the long-term stuff can be pretty fucking good), and the in-ring work is a bit more freeing (still psychologically bankrupt); not the best or the worst you'll see. For my money, only a handful of truly 'elite' talents out there. You shouldn't be watching for the wrestling itself but for everything that happens around it - It's a tv show first, a live wrestling show second, or third. They also must deal with ""real life shit"" that america has to pretend to care about, which affects booking decisions. I can sometimes dig the tone of the show as ""smarter than usual"". However, it is still the same soulless, immoral, fickle fans that support this entertainment medium, so, many casuals or potential new fans will be turned off. The roster has grown large with many members and not enough time with which to build anything around.

2022-05-03,2.0," ""As much as I hoped AEW would succeed, it has failed to deliver on their promise, and is the very definition of overrated currently. For every good thing they do, they do at least two as bad. Extremely hit and miss variety show, with most shows leaning towards the latter. Their pay per views, for the most part, have been good, occasionally very good, but the womens division, overused ""comedy"" segments, repetition, and booking hasn't been up to scratch, and match quality nowhere near the heights suggested, outside of some excellent tag matches every so often, usually involving The Young Bucks. For me, AEW has lost it's charm, much of which is due to Tony Khan, including going against his word and becoming a weak on screen character and showing nothing of the sort ""sports presentation"", Kenny/Bucks/Cody social media antics and their own loss of charm, repetitive, weak booking, poor use of new talent, and being everything they said they wouldn't be. The world does not need a WWE lite, it needs an alternative. The ratings have gone down for these reasons; get back on track before it's too late. Of course, the hardcore fans will give you 5* matches or 10/10 for every show, but those that actually care about long term success and can see through the trees, know what changes need to be made. The promotion seems split down the middle at the moment, WWE Lite, and PWG Lite, with a little NJPW sprinkled in, which leads to nowhere. Go one way or the other, or better yet, become what you set out to be. The alternative that brings fans and promotions together to create something great. At the moment, it appears a promotion and fanbase that cannot accept any criticism, and thinks ""Everything Is Awesome! "" while things go from bad to worse. Get back to what it was in 2019 and revitalise the booking, utilise the talent at hand that know what works in 2022, and find the rewards. As it stands, this is a promotion going downhill and becoming a WWE alternative rather than a true alternative to WWE, yet has tremendous potential if it can stop being the self congratulatory promotion that wants to pat itself on the back, rather than achieve something special.

2022-02-27,6.0," ""Overrated, in my book. The company has a lot of strengths, to be sure. The presentation is fun. It has a lot of likeable talents with great careers ahead of them. I personally like the overloaded rotating roster and the win-loss system. There are a lot of good matches. Given a choice between WWE and AEW, I'd watch AEW every time. Unfortunately, the company also has its share of weaknesses that often get overlooked because people are so happy to have a big time alternative to the E. For me, the most glaring flaw is that the booking is completely predictable. There's a lot of telegraphing of what's going to happen because people are either on a roll or they're not or they've been on a roll for far too long. Surprise wins are few and far between. Too many matches rely on the ""fit-in-all-your-spots"" style found in the indies and very little actual ring psychology. There are way too many near-fall kickouts, which, again, is a sign of a lack of understanding of ring psychology -- there are moves that wrestlers shouldn't be able to kick out of without someone else breaking up the count, and no one should *ever* be able to kick out after, say, taking a hit to the head from a foreign object unless someone else is there to make the save. This insults the intelligence of viewers. There is also a lack of consistency when it comes to the company's rules themselves... being the number one contender is important until someone else wins a random one-off special match or just decides to challenge for a belt out of the blue.

Off the top of my head: the women's scene is still scant and often embarrassing, with two champs that have great character work and promos but amateurish skills; far too often there will be multi-man tag spotfests that are carbon copies of each other week after week; there are plenty of goofy and unskilled individuals and tag teams that the company still haven't shaken off after first getting established 2 years ago; there are plenty of stars they're keeping in limbo by placing them in bland feuds with total nobodies; plus many other annoyances. But forget all that, because this is a company that gives good, standard storytelling with developments and conclusions that feel logical (at least as far as ""wrestling logic"" is expected to go), with the fanbase being for the most part happy with the majority of what has been presented. All the stories/runs developments over the last year involving Omega, Page, Danielson, Cody, MJF, Punk, Kingston, Miro, Darby have ranged from very good to great, and there's no shortage of other stars for them to likewise push and develop in interesting and exciting ways. The company really took a step up in 2021 when they started making all those major signings. Now look at the roster! There's a great mix of absolute stars, great wrestlers on the cusp of becoming stars with the right booking, fantastic young up-and-comers, solid workhorses, past-their-prime veterans who are still good hands, and various other decent mid-carders and lower-carders who help fill up ranks. When rumours star brewing around AEW, they're usually correct AND they're paid off well, which is very rare these days. I personally think that basically all AEW matches that get the ""best match ever! "" reactions are vastly overrated, since I've only given a handful of AEW matches ****1/4 at the absolute highest, but the company still has probably at least one great match every other month, plus a bunch of matches each month ranging from pretty good to very good, ensuring that weekly Dynamite and Rampage episodes are interesting.

2021-10-24,7.0," ""AEW has, for the most part, hit it out of the park so far. Most episodes of TV are usually at least passable, which can't always be said about WWE (their biggest competition). Match quality is usually good, however my biggest issue with AEW is it's storytelling, or, in the case of the women's division, non-existent storytelling. It's usually either barely there or set up on one of the YouTube shows. The exception is usually for PPV's but those are very infrequent. The world champion is regularly treading water with no storyline going on. The tag belts are usually the same way but to a lesser extent. The TNT title usually has a story going on, and if it doesn't it's usually made up for in open challenges. Women's title is the biggest victim, with little storytelling or promos from anyone besides Britt Baker. The challenger sometimes never gets to talk in the build to the title match. It's honestly tragic. Another issue I have with AEW is an issue with predictability. Almost every match on Dynamite every single week has an obvious result days before the match even takes place. As I said earlier, the matches usually deliver, but frequently lack heat because the winner is already known, so any nearfalls the loser of the match gets, the audience can't buy into it. Regardless of those significant issues, I have some other things I like AEW does. One of them is that they listen to their fanbase. If an angle doesn't get over or work out it is usually scrapped in a way that makes sense. I also like how they consistently try to make wrestling a focal point of their programming as opposed to 20 minute in ring promos. I also like how they make their titles feel important by protecting them from eating unnecessary losses in matches that aren't for the title. Overall, AEW has a lot of upside, but some major flaws prevent me from rating it any higher than a 7.""",Mark,aew has for the most part hit it out of the park so far most episodes of tv are usually at least passable which cant always be said about wwe their biggest competition match quality is usually good however my biggest issue with aew is its storytelling or in the case of the womens division nonexistent storytelling its usually either barely there or set up on one of the youtube shows the exception is usually for ppvs but those are very infrequent the world champion is regularly treading water with no storyline going on the tag belts are usually the same way but to a lesser extent the tnt title usually has a story going on and if it doesnt its usually made up for in open challenges womens title is the biggest victim with little storytelling or promos from anyone besides britt baker the challenger sometimes never gets to talk in the build to the title match its honestly tragic another issue i have with aew is an issue with predictability almost every match on dynamite every single week has an obvious result days before the match even takes place as i said earlier the matches usually deliver but frequently lack heat because the winner is already known so any nearfalls the loser of the match gets the audience cant buy into it regardless of those significant issues i have some other things i like aew does one of them is that they listen to their fanbase if an angle doesnt get over or work out it is usually scrapped in a way that makes sense i also like how they consistently try to make wrestling a focal point of their programming as opposed to minute in ring promos i also like how they make their titles feel important by protecting them from eating unnecessary losses in matches that arent for the title overall aew has a lot of upside but some major flaws prevent me from rating it any higher than a,334

Conclusion: Of course, not all gold is what glues, AEW is not the egg-laying wool milk sau des wrestling, it can not be, as well, tastes are too different (even if that felt have expected some and now disappointed). If you still get the Womens Division, I am personally happy with the product that is offered here. There are always simple edit: The Roster has become even stronger, with Black, Punk, Cole, Danielson, Garcia, etc. That raises the overall quality of the product again. Although the Women's Division is still the vulnerability, but also there you have improved significantly, as well as in Championchip, as well as below.

2021-09-18,9.0," ""2021 Edit: At the start of the year, I was a bit skeptic about that this year will eventually be the downfall of AEW after it's first glorious year, but boy was I wrong, not only did it do that and pick itself for the amazing run it is currently having, but it quickly made way for competition, a competition that other promotions solely needed to improve their product as well. Most people have had AEW as an alternative to WWE since it's inception 2 years ago, and quickly moved it's way to the top that near ends their flagship program in the ratings, and somewhat in the quality as well. I do believe WWE has had better matches this year considerably while told better stories in their matches and the ones leading up to it, so what makes AEW better? The booking and how to handle a wrestler individually, how to make them fucking stars. WWE does that by abrupt cash-ins that feels rushed in, AEW is a slow burn that makes it work, Britt Baker being an example, can't wrestle for shit, but the way she's booked as a charismatic heel, is why she's at the top, it's amazing how they accomplished that, and for smart writers and helps it being a more mature programming work, they're expanding themselves in the realm of modern mainstream wrestling. So why not a perfect 10? A) The booking's not always perfect, and sometimes have piss poor booking decisions. B) The toxicity they reek of, in this site, on Twitter, on any other social media site, biased criticism even by the ""holy gospel"" of Journalists in Meltzer (How is Ilja Dragunov vs Walter a 5.25/the triple threat at Mania 37 a 4.5/Gargano vs Kushida a 4.75, when an indie spotfest that has always had the same feel to it 5+ stars), Dirt Sheet and Alvarez. Why can't they enjoy both when both of them are doing great currently and let others enjoy what they want to, that question is always beyond me. Hope that does change soon though. C) Can't seem not to make this about themselves, always have to drag WWE in any promo chance they get with the inferiority complex they have, Punk did it in his debut, Britt Baker did it recently, you get the point, I don't have much space to conclude.

AEW is maybe the worst thing for wrestling today, even pretending to ""open"", or just even pretending to be a promotion for young talents. Because this is what they said at the beginning. Who were and is AEW World Champion since the starting of the company ? Jericho, a true legend I have no problem to say that, Moxley, an ex WWE champ, and Omega, a wrestler that won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. And with these young big talents, like Guevara or Kip Sabian, who are not really known from most of wrestling fans, because they are from the indies ( and they did a great job in them, no problem with that ), they prefer push MJF. Really ? Saying that makes me laugh, but it's the reality. When I started watching AEW, I was in a point of my life as wrestling fan where I was not too much into it, so I really liked the Dynamite episodes, and you can even see a full 10 in my matchguide for an AEW match ( and moreover, it's a Young Bucks match, what I really can't do today, because I grown since Revolution 2020 as a wrestling fan ). I discovered so many promotions in 2020. TJPW. DDT. NOAH, etc. I really started to dislike the AEW product at this period, doing always the same things, Cody being overpushed and egomaniac as one of the biggest guys in the federation, outside of the screen. Then before the biggest point of my comment, let's talk about Tony Khan, who pretends to be someone who saves today's wrestling. But no, he is just choosing to destroy it, piece by piece. AEW's fanbase is awful. The worst fanbase I have ever seen, like it's said in the comment just below me, calling someone who doesn't like their products ""WWE marks"", and understanding nothing. Now, let's talk about why AEW is destroying wrestling today. They already destroyed Impact so much that I don't even watch it anymore, and for those who knows me well, they know that Impact is a federation that I love from the bottom of my heart since I started to watch wrestling. Omega as Impact champ is a shame and someone who doesn't understand it is simply unable to see the symbolic of this. The Impact shows are just AEW's garbage. They put Private Party here just because they had no storylines in AEW, and because for them Impact is inferior. AEW have adds for their weekly shows in every Impact show, and what Impact has in return ? Nothing, not even having a guy of the company as World Champion. AEW's partnership with Impact destroyed the so meaningful storyline between Swann and Moose. They get exposition ? No, they get destroyed. Like the poor Konosuke Takeshita, one of the best in the world, who went to AEW to be in Dark Elevation, a jobber show. This is the exposition ? Lol.

Long has the wrestling world cried out for an alternative to sports entertainment on this scale and I believe that AEW are mostly delivering. The in-ring style has a feel that once would be described as ""indie"", that now could really just be described as the standard pro wrestling style outside of WWE. The pace is quick and workrate high, rest holds being reserved for ad breaks during Dynamite where the coverage for international audiences remains uninterrupted and the US viewership are treated to the famous ""pitcher in pitcher"". On this very important facet they are unmatched by their American peers, head and shoulders above other wrestling network television presentations. That said, they are far within the boundaries for valid criticism on many fronts. Production is lacking with sound levels failing to be normalized and important spots missed. Forgivable in their freshman year, less so now. Nepotism within the Nightmare Family has led to bad angles, from bizarre to shambolic, and even at a title level storylines have often gone weeks without address, and too often petered out altogether. Boss Tony Khan is clearly a fan first, and while this is more beneficial than detrimental in my eyes, it does lead to his foot in his mouth too often for my liking, both when on promotional duty and in his post-show scrums. Despite all this, however, to rate it any lower than I have done would be a disservice. AEW have raised the bar for the entire North American scene at the top level. If WWE ran weekly shows the quality of AEW before the latter's inception, we would declare it a new golden era for the fed.

2021-04-04,9.0," ""Really refreshing promotion for those who like sports entertainment but get put off by alternative scripted, over-produced & sanitised products. ***Pros (In my opinion)*** Talent have a great deal of creative freedom, if nailed can reap high rewards (i. e Darby Allin, MJF, Inner Circle) The same can be said for matches themselves, there is a good dose of psychology mixed with flashy high spots which breeds it's own type of promotional product. More of an adult product (Blood, swearing/cursing, weapons ect) This is a subjective pro I know but for people like me who like to see colour like you would on the street, it's great. Also gives you a great feeling of 'Attitude Era Nostalgia' but with new talent which keeps you coming back, if thats your cup of tea. Great use of veteran talent (i. e Sting, Taz, Jake the Snake, Jericho are all being used as managers/mouth pieces to get younger stars over) Hotbed of young talent (i. e Sammy G, Darby, MJF, Private Party, Adam Page, John Silver are just a fraction to name) Greatest Tag Division in Wrestling (i. e Bucks, FTR, Lucha Bros, Proud & Powerful, SCU, TH2, Best Friends, Dark Order ect) ***Cons (In my opinion)*** Women's division is poor, Hikaru Shida, Britt Baker & Nyla Rose are a few standout names in what has proved to have been a lackluster women's product since AEW's inception. I am not a fan of women's wrestling personally but I must admit at the time of typing this, a few weeks ago, Britt Baker and Thunder Rosa had one of the best matches i've seen in a long time (any gender) so there is hope...

2021-03-13,6.0," ""As we approach a year and a half of AEW TV I think it's worth giving an initial appraisal. While absolutely beloved in the west, the reality is that AEW for many of the original fans of the core group of wrestlers was false advertising. It was purported to be something akin to a western take on New Japan featuring all those great work rate guys from the indies and the elite. It was going to take back wrestling for the fan and the wrestler. To some extent it did accomplish this. It's clear that working in the environment is better for the wrestlers, but it failed on a sports presentation front. AEW is essentially a Super Indy on TV. A mixture of old school 90s wrestling with modern work rate guys and a tongue in cheek modern Indy-like feel. For simplicity sake WCW crossed with PWG. Or Perhaps even more simply a better WWE that is more meta. I did not really want to see American TV Wrestling, I wanted to see a true evolution. Maybe the true evolution is not a revert to it's more sports flavored origin, but doing WWE's style better with twists wasn't exactly what I was clamoring for. AEW as whole is incredibly hit or miss. Miro and Kip doing some weird twitch gamer hype beast gimmick is a miss, but paired the Trent and Chuckie T I enjoyed. They have had moments of true brilliance like the Hangman and Omega feud, or the first Moxley vs. Omega, but then they had stuff like the original Dark Order presentation. I know precisely what I want from a wrestling company thanks to watching AEW. It's compelling stories featuring convincing characters that pay off with great matches, and championships that mean something. And AEW can achieve this on a rare occasions, but not as consistently as I would like. One of my major complaints is the failure of AEW to deliver a truly great overall PPV. They have not hit that for me yet, which is probably not the case for most people. The closest they came for me was DoN 2019, but the only truly great match was Dustin vs. Cody. Revolution 2020 had an amazing run on TV up to the PPV, but the PPV itself was quite weak. They sometimes wait far too long to build up meaningful feuds in time for the PPVs this has been a major issue. All Out 2020 is a prime example of this. The women's division is also a mess. The roster itself has improved a lot with additions like Leyla Hirsch, Thunder Rosa, and Serena Deeb, but has some major problems. Most of them just aren't good enough especially compared to their contemporaries in NXT which arguably has the best women's roster in the world and this coming from someone who watches a ton of Joshi.

2021-10-02,9.0," ""As of February 2021, I would give All Elite Wrestling a 9 out of 10. For all of the things that one can nitpick, Tony Khan and the creative minds behind the promotion have put together the most exciting wrestling program in the US since WCW's Monday Nitro in the mid 1990s. Anyone complaining about the in-ring style is missing out on what makes AEW so unique. It's a criticism that has held wrestling back for far too long and did so much damage to promotions like IMPACT and WCW over time. AEW should feel no need to compete with the WWE and no fan should expect that, especially from an in-ring perspective. The criticisms of the women's division are completely valid. However, while AEW cannot compete with the WWE, the WWE still does contract the VAST MAJORITY of well trained, high level wrestlers (and trainers) in the US which left AEW with very few options to build their roster. The usage (or lack-thereof) of the women's division is where I would like to see some improvement. My other criticism stems from the ""sports entertainment"" aspects of the show. Some segments and characters have drifted too far away from the realm of professional wrestling. While I realize not everything has to appeal to me, I have also found AEW's attempts to appeal to casual/new fans as off-putting. From Tyson to Shaq, all of these attempts at generating interest haven't hit with me. I think their best attempt at this was Snoop Dogg's feature, which is all I'd ever want from a celebrity appearance on a wrestling show. AEW Dark has been a great proving ground for both female and male talents. I look forward to seeing a third hour of programming. One element I'd love to see added would be a trios championship, as I feel AEW's roster is built for such an idea. Working relationships with IMPACT and other US independent promotions could open up the door for greener talent on both sides of the roster to get reps and improve down the line. I firmly believe the pandemic hindered much of what AEW had planned for 2020 yet their adaptations were excellent for such a new promotion. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that no promotion was better booked in 2020. I truly appreciate their ability to keep me interested week after week. While I've found myself disagreeing with different elements of the show, they've consistently found a way to hook me back in. With an absolute wealth of young, albeit inexperienced, talent I believe All Elite Wrestling is a promotion that has defied critics expectations and will continue to grow and improve over time. Their newly established relationship with New Japan Pro-Wrestling will only solidify this belief. The promotion's approach to the wrestling business as a whole should only contribute to its positive standing with fans as they exist to elevate wrestling as a whole, NOT to buy up everything around them and be the only show in town.

Every commentator seems to have different names for almost every move, which is irritating. Talking of moves, AEW wrestlers often use other AEW wrestlers finishers within their standard movesets, which for me kind of ruins that finisher (would be like Ishii giving Okada a Rainmaker onto a chair and not going for the cover as its a standard move, then Okada winning with a regular Rainmaker).

If I see guys like Joey Janela, Marko Stunt or Orange Cassidy with his shit-Gimmick, I wonder what you want to tear those? And these are only three of very many, where I ask myself the question.
